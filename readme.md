About Team Mustache

Mustache Monitor was conceived on the eve of Movember - the preeminent month to raise awareness for Men's health. During Movember Men around the globe sprout upper lip hair and show off their industrious stache growth.

Mustache Monitor is an iOS app to document daily stache production and create an animation of your incredible journey through Movember. What's better then having a robust stache? Sharing it with the world.

Show your MO!
